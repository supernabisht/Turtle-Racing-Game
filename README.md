# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game

A colorful and fun Python mini-game where six turtles race across the screen — and **you get to bet on your favorite!** It’s a perfect beginner-friendly project built using Python’s `turtle` module and a great way to learn about OOP, randomness, and event handling.

4. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins!
5. If your turtle wins, you win the bet — otherwise, try again!
